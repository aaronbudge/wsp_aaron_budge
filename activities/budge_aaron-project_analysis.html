					<h2>Site Intent</h2>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>Soundstream Entertainment is a local professional DJ service that specializes in corporate, school, and private parties. The goals outlined within the project requirements include, increasing site traffic, attracting new and existing clients, and converting them into potential contracts by persuading them to fill out a request form.
					</p>
					<p>After examining the current website, it has been determined that a complete re-design is required to meet the listed goals. In its immediate state, the site does not meet current web standards, utilizes non-semantic markup, and lacks a clear hierarchy in structure, layout and design. In addition, the user interface is clumsy, outdated, and fails to present Soundstream Entertainment with a professional image.
					</p>
					<p>In order to reach the outlined goals of increasing site traffic, attracting and engaging the target audience, and increasing the number of submitted “request a quote” forms, we will take the following steps.
					</p>
					<h4>Web Standards</h4>
					<p>Re-build the site utilizing clean, semantic markup that adheres to current web standards, and passes the W3C validation tests.</p>
					<h4>Layout, Structure, and Information Architecture (AI)</h4>
					<p>Asses and re-build the current layout, structure, and information architecture to clarify, re-organize, and present the required content in a logical, intuitive, and informative manner that best represents the company, and engages the target audience.</p>
					<h4>User Interface (UI)</h4>
					<p>Create a new visual design for the user interface that meets the expectations of the target audience. Present the new look and feel through the use of external css stylesheets and current best practices, attracting more users to the site, and increasing the number of visited pages, and the amount of time spent on each pageview.</p>

					<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>Like most direct competitors, the Soundstream Entertainment website does not currently produce enough data for Alexa.com to generate a global traffic rank or any other demographics. The lack of a strong web presence among competitors, suggests a strong opportunity to increase site traffic and generate new conversions.Listed below are the top competitors for DJ services in the Reno area.
					</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.gigmasters.com">www.gigmasters.com</a></p>
					<p>GigMasters have built a reputation for having what they say is, “the web's largest selection of the best, client-reviewed entertainers and party vendors.” They have a global traffic rank of 39,027, with the average site visitor viewing 3.4 unique pages per day. A typical visitor to their site is a moderately educated female between the age of 35 and 55, and will spend roughly 44 seconds on each pageview for a total of 4 minutes on the site.
					</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.wedj.com">www.wedj.com</a></p>
					<p>Wedj.com is a directory service that boasts a database of over 20,000 professional DJ’s across the United States. They have a global traffic rank of 199,643, with the average site visitor viewing 2.8 unique pages per day, for 38 seconds each. There most common site visitor is between the age of 35 - 65 years old, female, and browses the site from home.
					</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.renomobiledjs.com">www.renomobiledjs.com</a></p>
					<p>Reno Mobile DJ’s is a local DJ service that competes directly with SoundStream Entertainment in the Reno area, and has an Alexa Global Rank of 5,782,13. Other than the Alexa Global Rank, the site does not provide enough data for Alexa to generate any additional demographics.
					</p>
					<p>In addition to the previous three competitors, a Google search of the term “reno nevada djs” produces three other local DJ’s that compete directly with Soundstream Entertainment, and do not generate a rank or demographics on Alexa.com.
					</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.renodj.com">www.renodj.com</a></p>					
					<p><a href="http://www.renodjs.com">www.renodjs.com</a></p>
					<p><a href="http://www.allaboutthemusicdj.com">www.allaboutthemusicdj.com</a></p>
					<p>Due to the lack of data regarding site traffic and audience demographics among competitors, assessing website analytics for the current website is recommended to provide additional insight.

					<h2>Target Audience</h2>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>My research shows that the target audience for DJ services primarily consists of married women with children, ages 35 -55, and spans both residential and commercial market segments. The following user personas will help maximize the user experience by implementing a user centered approach in developing the new user interface.
