					<h3>School Dances</h3>
					<p>Wether it’s a Junior Prom, or a  simple mixer, we know that school dances are important to your students. We pride ourselves on being able to not only meet the expectations of your students, but at the same time, work with chaperones and school officials to provide appropriate music and adhere to school policies.</p>
					<p>Our huge up-to-date collection of over 30,000 radio edited music ensure that your students will have an up-beat and memorable experience with the perfect blend of popular music.</p>
					<p>While we only use radio-edited “clean” material, some of the music is still not suitable for elementary or middle school age children, and will not be played. We do, however, play them for high school age events unless we are instructed not to.</p>
